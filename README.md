## Warrior's Vault: Password Crackerüõ°Ô∏è‚öîÔ∏è

**Warrior's Vault** is a powerful password cracking tool designed to help users recover lost passwords using various methods, including brute force, dictionary attacks, and hybrid approaches. It supports both MD5 and SHA256 hash types.

### Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Assesses the strength of a given password based on length and complexity.
- **Brute Force Cracking Method**: Attempts to crack passwords using a brute-force approach by generating possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Cracks passwords using a predefined wordlist to find matches.
- **Hybrid Cracking Method**: Combines dictionary and brute-force methods, allowing for suffixes to be appended to words in the dictionary.
- **MD5 Hash Generator**: Generates MD5 hashes for input strings.
- **SHA-256 Hash Generator**: Generates SHA-256 hashes for input strings.
- **Logging**: Records successful password cracks and their strength in a log file for reference.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: An engaging command-line interface that guides users through the password cracking process.

### Hash Generators

This project includes two hash generator functions that allow users to generate MD5 and SHA-256 hashes from input strings. These functions provide a straightforward way to obtain hashed representations of passwords or any other text, enhancing the tool's utility for security analysis and password management.

- **MD5 Hash Generator**: Generates an MD5 hash from a given input string. While MD5 is fast, it is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use in security-sensitive applications.

- **SHA-256 Hash Generator**: Produces a SHA-256 hash, a member of the SHA-2 family, which is significantly more secure than MD5 and widely used in various security applications and protocols.


### Requirements
